## Ingredience

* 2 c. melted refined or unrefined coconut oil
* 2 c. brown sugar
* 1 c. granulated sugar
* 8 tsp. vanilla extract
* 4 egg
* 4 c. old-fashioned whole rolled oats - not instant or quick cook
* 4 c. all-purpose flour
* 4 tsp. baking soda
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 3 c. sweetened shredded coconut flakes
* 2 c. extra baking raisins
 
## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the melted coconut oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract; beat until smooth. Add the egg and mix until combined.
2. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold in the raisins and coconut.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C); line baking sheets with parchment paper or baking mats. Place 12 cookies on a sheet. Place in the oven and bake for 10-11 minutes, being careful not to overbake! The cookies will look soft and slightly underbaked, but they should be firm on the edges and lightly brown on top. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the pans for 2-3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
