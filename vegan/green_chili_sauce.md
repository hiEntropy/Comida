## Ingredience 

* 6 Anaheim peppers
* 4 Jalapeno peppers
* 1 Onion
* 8 Garlic Cloves
* 6 Tomatillos
* Olive Oil Cooking Spray
* 1 teaspoon Sea Salt
* 1 tablespoon Garlic Powder
* 1 tablespoon Onion Powder
* 1 tablespoon Salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°.
2. Remove seeds and membranes from peppers, cut into large chunks. (Note: please use gloves when cutting up peppers.) Cut onion into chunks. Place peppers, onion and garlic cloves into sauce pan. Cover with water and bring to a low boil on medium heat. Cook for about 15 minutes, until soft.
3. Spray baking sheet with cooking spray.
4. Remove outer husk from tomatillos and wash well to remove any sticky residue. Cut each tomatillo in half, horizontally.
5. Place tomatillos, cut side down, on sprayed baking sheet. Spray tops with cooking spray and sprinkle with sea salt.
6. Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes, until soft. Use caution when removing because the tomatillos can burst into liquid. Set aside.
7. Once peppers are softened, allow to cool about 10 minutes. Do not discard liquid. Using a slotted spoon, remove pepper mixture to blender to process only half at a time. Add a little bit of liquid from peppers to blender, just enough to allow the blender to process (about ¼ to ½ cup). Process peppers and tomatillos fully. Discard remaining liquid. Return to pan.
8. Add remaining seasonings and heat on medium for 15 minutes. Makes one quart (62 tablespoons).
