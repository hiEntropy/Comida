# Vegan Scalloped Potatoes

A creamy, dairy-free, plant-based take on classic scalloped potatoes, featuring a cashew-based sauce and optional vegan cheese topping.

## Ingredients

### Potatoes

- 2 lb Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed and sliced 1/8" thick  
- 8 slices vegan cheese (optional, for topping)  
- ¼ cup fresh herbs (e.g., chives or thyme), for garnish  

### Dairy-Free Cream Sauce

- ¾ cup raw cashew pieces  
- 1¾ cups water  
- 1 tbsp onion powder  
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast  
- 2 tsp dijon mustard  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1¼ tsp sea salt  
- ¾ tsp smoked paprika  

## Equipment

- Mandolin (with guard) or sharp knife  
- 8x10 inch baking dish  
- Blender (e.g., Vitamix)  
- Oven preheated to 375°F  

## Directions

1. **Preheat & Prep**  
   Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil an 8x10 baking dish or line with parchment paper.  
   Slice Yukon gold potatoes into 1/8" rounds. Rinse slices in cold water, then drain well.

2. **Layer the Potatoes**  
   Transfer potato slices to the baking dish and spread evenly.  
   *(Optional: for filled versions, layer half the potatoes, add filling such as sautéed mushrooms or leeks, then top with remaining potatoes.)*

3. **Make the Sauce**  
   In a high-speed blender, combine all sauce ingredients. Blend until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust salt if needed.

4. **Assemble & Bake**  
   Pour sauce evenly over the potatoes. Gently shake dish to distribute.  
   *(Optional: layer vegan cheese slices on top for a gratin-style finish.)*  
   Cover tightly with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Increase oven to 400°F and bake another 15 minutes until potatoes are tender.  
   For crispy edges, uncover for the last 10 minutes of baking.

5. **Serve**  
   Sprinkle with fresh herbs and a pinch of red chili flakes if desired. Serve hot.

## Notes

- **Potatoes:**  
  Yukon golds are preferred for their buttery texture and thin skins—no peeling required. If using russets, peel before slicing.

- **Cheese (Optional):**  
  Though traditional scalloped potatoes are cheese-free, topping with vegan cheese makes them similar to au gratin. Great options include smoked gouda or provolone-style slices from Violife or Follow Your Heart.

- **Flavor Variations:**  
  Add 1–2 tsp liquid smoke to the sauce for a smoky twist.  
  Optional fillings: caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, leeks, garlic spinach. Layer between potato slices before baking.

- **Make Ahead Tips:**  
  Slice potatoes the night before and store submerged in cold water in the fridge to prevent browning.

- **Storage:**  
  Refrigerate leftovers up to 5 days. Reheat at 350°F for ~35 minutes or in the microwave. Freezing is not recommended—texture may change, though flavor remains.
