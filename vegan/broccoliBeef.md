## Ingredience

* 8-12 oz soy crumbles (lite life)
* 1 pound broccoli florets
* 1-3 tablespoons olive oil
 

Sauce 

* 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce, *use tamari for gluten free
* 2 tablespoons kitchen bouquet, optional
* 3 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1/3 cup water
* 1 teaspoon red chili flakes
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger
* 5 cloves minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch

Serving 

* 4-5 cups white or brown rice 
* green onions 
* sesame seeds 

## Directions

1. Mix all the sauce ingrediences together and set aside 
2. In a large saut√© pan or wok, add the broccoli and 1/2 cup water. Turn the heat to high, cover and steam the broccoli for about 2 minutes until bright green and slightly softened. Then remove the broccoli to a plate nearby.
3. To the empty pan, add 1-3 tablespoons of oil, then add the soy curls and fry, stirring frequently for 4-5 minutes until a bit golden and crisp. I also like to add a few tablespoons of kitchen bouquet while frying, which helps make the soy curls nice and brown. Remove from the pan and set on a plate. You may omit the oil if you have a very good non-stick pan, otherwise the soy curls will stick. Turn the heat down to medium.
4. Whisk the sauce once more, then add to the pan with the soy curls. Stir constantly for a minute or two, until the sauce thickens, then add the broccoli back in and stir. Serve immediately over rice topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Enjoy!
