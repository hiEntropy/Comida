## Ingredience

* 3 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 small onion, diced (about 1/2 – 3/4 cup)
* 1 1/2 cup arborio rice
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
* 2 small zucchini, grated
* 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (or 2–3 tablespoons vegan parmesan)
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
2. Sauté onion until translucent and add rice, allowing it to absorb any remaining oil.
3. Pour the white wine into the pan and allow it to absorb.
4. Add broth – a 1/2 cup at a time – allowing each addition be fully absorbed before adding the next, stirring frequently.
5. Once broth is incorporated, stir in shredded zucchini. Allow any liquids from the zucchini to absorb into the rice.
6. Stir in nutritional yeast and stir to incorporate.
7. Before serving, season with salt & pepper, to taste.
