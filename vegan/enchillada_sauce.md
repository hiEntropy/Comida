## Ingredience

* 3 tablespoons water
* 3 tablespoons all purpose flour, | gluten-free if needed
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Directions

1. Measure and add all the dry ingredients to a small bowl (flour, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and salt). Have the tomato paste and vegetable broth ready and nearby.
2. In a medium pot over medium heat, warm the water. Once warm, pour in the flour/spice mixture and whisk constantly for about a minute. Whisk in the tomato paste, then slowly pour in the broth, whisking constantly.
3. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes, whisking often to remove lumps. It should thicken a bit. Remove from heat, and whisk in the vinegar. Taste and add more salt as needed. Set aside.
