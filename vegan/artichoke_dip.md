## Directions

* Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
* Soak the cashews: Heat up about 3 cups of water in a tea kettle or small pot. Pour the boiling hot water over the cashews and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain them when ready to blend.
* In a small pan, saute the garlic and onion for 2-3 minutes using either a tablespoon of olive oil or water, until the onion is slightly translucent. Set aside.
* In a high powered blender such as a Vitamix, add the soaked, drained cashews, unsweetened milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon salt. Blend until very smooth. 
* Now add the cooked onions/garlic, spinach and artichokes. Pulse a couple of times, but do not blend. You want to leave quite a bit of chunky texture! Taste for salt, add more to taste.
* Transfer to an oven safe dish (I used a 9 inch pie dish) and bake for 20 minutes or so until warm, bubbly and golden brown on top. 
* Sprinkle with vegan parmesan , if desired and serve with a sliced baguette, pita chips, tortilla chips or vegetable sticks. Enjoy!
