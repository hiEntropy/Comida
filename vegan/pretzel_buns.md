## Cook Time 

32 minutes

## Ingredience 


* 2 1/4 tsp Active Dry Yeast (or 1 .25 oz packet)
* 1 cup Warm Water
* 2 tbsp Coconut Sugar
* 2 1/2 cup All Purpose Flour, plus more if necessary
* 1 tsp Salt
* Coarse Sea Salt, for sprinkling on top (optional)
* 7 cup Water
* 1/2 cup Baking Soda


## Directions

1. Add the Yeast and 1 cup of Warm Water to a large, non-metal bowl. Note: The water should be warm, but not hot. You should be able to comfortably hold your finger in it.  
2. Sprinkle the Coconut Sugar over top of the Yeast Mixture and briefly stir everything together. Let sit for 5 minutes, or until the Yeast has activated and there is a layer of foam on top of the liquid.
3. Begin to slowly add in the All Purpose Flour in ⅓ – ½ cup intervals. 
4. Once the mixture forms a pancake-like batter, sprinkle another layer of Flour on top of the dough, then sprinkle the Salt on top of the mixture as well. Mix thoroughly.
5. Continue to add the remaining flour, until the dough is moist, but not sticky. Once it becomes hard to stir with a spatula, transfer to a floured baking surface and knead with your hands for 5-10 minutes. 
6. Rinse the bowl out with water, but do not dry. Return the dough to the bowl and turn it around a few times so that it becomes coated with a thin layer of water – this will prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl. 
7. Cover with a towel and store in a warm place until doubled inside, about 45 – 60 minutes
8. Punch the dough down, then form into 6 – 8 even balls (I made 8). Keep in mind these balls will expand further throughout the cooking process. 
9. Preheat your oven to 400F. 
10. Add the Baking Soda and 7 cups of Water to a large pot, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add each dough ball into the pot. I did three at a time, but if your pot is large, I would recommend you do four. 
11. Allow each roll to cook for 2 minutes, then flip in the water, and allow to cook for another 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the roll from the pot and place onto a baking tray lined with either parchment paper or a silicone mat. Repeat until all of the dough balls have been cooked. 
12. If desired, cut an “X” into the top of each roll, and sprinkle generously with coarse salt. 
13. Bake at 400F for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the tops of the rolls are golden brown. 
14. Serve immediately, or store at room temperature in a bread bag or an airtight container for up to 5 days. These also fare well in the freezer for up to 2 months.
