## Prep Time 

However long it takes you to make sauce and cheese 

## Cook Time 

20-25 minutes

## Ingredience 

1. Nacho Cheese Sauce (see recipe)
2. Meat Substitute (see recipe)
3. Enchillada sauce (see recipe)
3. 8 Torillas 
4. 1/2 cup red onions for topping 
5. Cilantro for topping 
6. Corn for topping or inside, either is fine

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole dish.
2. Wrap 5 tortillas at a time in a damp paper towel, and microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute to soften. This will make them much easier to roll.
3. Fill each tortilla with a scoop of "meat" and a spoonful of cheese sauce. Roll and place into the prepared pan. Repeat until all the tortillas are used. Pour the rest of the enchilada sauce on top, then pour the rest of the cheese on top of the red sauce. 
4. Bake, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, until bubbly. Top with chopped cilantro and serve hot.
