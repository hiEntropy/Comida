## Servings 

1 Pizza 12 inch thick   
or   
1 pizza 16 inch thin  

## Prep Time 

20 minutes

## Cook Time 

10-15 minutes

## Ingredience

* 3/4 cup warm water
* 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 tsp organic sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 cups all-purpose flour 

## Directions

1. Stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let activate for 10 minutes – it should become foamy. If it's not foamy, then the yeast is may be too old or your water was too hot.
2. Stir in oil and salt.
3. Mix in 1/2 cup flour at a time.
4. Knead (using your hands or a dough hook in a stand mixer) until it forms a cohesive ball. It will still be a little sticky but you should be able to pick it up as one piece. If it's far too sticky, add 1-2 more tablespoons of flour at a time until it comes together.
5. Continue to knead for 5 minutes. 
6. Place the ball of dough into a large greased bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm location for 1 hour or until doubled in size. I let my dough rise in the oven with JUST the oven light on.
7. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (make sure to remove the dough from the oven if you let it rise in there.)
8. Punch the dough down and knead a couple of times until it becomes smooth and more firm. At this point, you can store the fridge in the freezer until later…or make a pizza!
9. Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Use your pizza pan for size reference (this recipe makes one 12-inch thick-crust pizza.)
10. Sprinkle the pizza pan with a pinch or two of flour and transfer the dough onto the pan. Work the dough to fit the edges. 
11. Brush the dough with 1-2 tbsp of olive oil (this helps the top of the dough stay moist and not overcook.)
12. Poke the dough all over with a fork – this will prevent the dough from puffing up. 
13. Pre-bake the dough for 5-7 minutes or until the bottom is just barely beginning to brown. At this point, the pizza should be able to lift out of the pan with a spatula. 
14. Remove from the oven, brush the crust with 1-2 tablespoons of melted vegan butter, and add your toppings. 
15. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are cooked through.
