2. Add liquids and simmer: Add diced tomatoes, tomato paste, vegetable broth, cannellini beans, and all of seasonings. On low-medium heat, cover and let soup simmer for 30 minutes - stir occasionally. Turn burner off and stir in kale leaves.
3. Taste and serve: Before serving, taste the soup. If it needs more flavor add a pinch more salt at a time until just right. Note: salt is your friend. It doesn't just add to a dish, it draws out flavor from the ingredients. Garnish with fresh chopped basil, grated parmesan, and serve!
