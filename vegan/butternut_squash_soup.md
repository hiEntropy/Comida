# Butternut Squash Soup

A cozy, creamy, and herbaceous butternut squash soup perfect for fall or winter meals. Garnish with pepitas and parsley, and serve with crusty bread.

## Ingredients

### Soup Base

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped  
- ½ teaspoon sea salt  
- 1 (3-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed  
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped  
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage  
- ½ tablespoon minced fresh rosemary  
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger  
- 3 to 4 cups vegetable broth  
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  

### For Serving

- Chopped parsley  
- Toasted pepitas  
- Crusty bread  

## Equipment

- 5.5-quart Dutch oven (e.g., Staub Cocotte)  
- Blender (e.g., Vitamix)  
- Ladle and mixing spoon  
- Cutting board and knife  

## Directions

1. **Sauté Aromatics**  
   Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Sauté for 5 to 8 minutes until the onion is soft and translucent.

2. **Cook the Squash**  
   Add the cubed butternut squash to the pot. Stir occasionally and cook until the squash begins to soften, about 8 to 10 minutes.

3. **Add Herbs & Garlic**  
   Stir in the chopped garlic, sage, rosemary, and grated ginger. Cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant.

4. **Simmer**  
   Pour in 3 cups of vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the squash is fully tender.

5. **Blend**  
   Let the soup cool slightly. Carefully transfer to a blender in batches and blend until completely smooth. If the soup is too thick, add up to 1 more cup of broth and blend again.

6. **Serve**  
   Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley, toasted pepitas, and a side of crusty bread.

## Notes

- A high-powered blender like a Vitamix will yield the smoothest texture.  
- You can roast the squash beforehand for added caramelized flavor.  
- Soup can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days or frozen for longer storage.
