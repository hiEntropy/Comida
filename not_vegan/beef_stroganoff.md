* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 8 ounces egg noodles, uncooked

## Directions
1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and browned, about 3-5 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
2. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks.  Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
5. Stir in beef stock, Worcestershire, Dijon and egg noodles; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer until pasta is cooked through, about 9-10 minutes.
6. Stir in sour cream until heated through, about 1-2 minutes.
7. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
