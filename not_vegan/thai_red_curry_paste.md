# Homemade Thai Red Curry Paste

A bold, fragrant red curry paste made from dried chilies, lemongrass, galangal, and other traditional Thai ingredients. Ideal for curries, soups, or marinades.

## Ingredients

- 16 dried chilies, chopped into 1 cm (½″) pieces, seeds shaken out¹  
- 2 tbsp lemongrass, sliced (from 1 large stalk, outer layers removed)²  
- 1 tbsp grated galangal, peeled³  
- 4 garlic cloves, whole  
- 1 tbsp shrimp paste in oil⁴  
- ½ tsp ground coriander  
- ½ tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tbsp chopped coriander/cilantro stems and roots⁵  
- 2 red shallots, peeled and roughly chopped⁶  
- 1 tsp lime zest  
- ¼ cup reserved chili soaking water  

## Equipment

- Blender or food processor (high-powered preferred)⁷  
- Bowl for soaking chilies  
- Airtight storage container  

## Directions

1. **Soak the Chilies**  
   Taste a piece of dried chili to judge spiciness. Place chopped chilies in a bowl and cover with 3 cups of freshly boiled water. Soak for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Drain & Reserve Water**  
   Remove chilies and set aside ¼ cup of the soaking water.

3. **Blend**  
   Add soaked chilies to a blender with all remaining ingredients, including the reserved soaking water.

4. **Process Until Smooth**  
   Blend on high until the paste is smooth—test texture by rubbing between fingers. This takes ~20 seconds in a Vitamix, or up to 1 minute in standard blenders. Add a splash more water if needed.

5. **Store**  
   Scrape paste into a bowl or airtight container. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze for long-term storage.

6. **Use**  
   Substitute for store-bought curry paste in Thai red curry recipes.

## Notes

¹ **Chilies**  
Generic Asian dried red chilies are ideal—flavorful but not overly spicy. Taste before using. If very spicy, reduce quantity. If using dried Thai chilies (much hotter), use only 6–8.

² **Lemongrass**  
Use tender inner portion only. Discard reedy outer leaves. Lemongrass paste in tubes is an acceptable substitute.

³ **Galangal Substitute**  
Galangal has a citrusy, pine-like aroma. If unavailable, use 1 tbsp ginger plus the zest of 1 lime.

⁴ **Shrimp Paste**  
Use shrimp paste in oil for richer flavor (e.g., Por Kwan brand). If using Belacan (dry shrimp paste), use 2 tsp crumbled and add directly to blender.

⁵ **Coriander Roots/Stems**  
Coriander roots are traditional but hard to find. Cleaned stems are a good alternative and easier to prep.

⁶ **Red Shallots**  
Also called eschalots or baby red onions. Provide a mild, sweet onion flavor.

⁷ **Blender vs Food Processor**  
Blenders (like Vitamix) yield smoother paste. Food processors can work with a smaller insert and added water.

## Tips

- **Texture**: Proper curry paste should be silky smooth—avoid graininess by finely grating fibrous ingredients like galangal and lemongrass.  
- **Storage**: Freeze in tablespoon portions for quick use.  
- **Flavor Booster**: Use shrimp paste in oil to replicate the richness developed when using a mortar and pestle.
