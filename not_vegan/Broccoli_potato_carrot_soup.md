# Broccoli Potato Carrot Soup

## Servings  
6–8 bowls  

## Prep Time  
15 minutes chopping vegetables  

## Cook Time  
25 minutes simmering  

## Ingredients  

* 2 Tbsp olive oil or butter  
* 1 medium onion, chopped  
* 2 garlic cloves, minced  
* 3 carrots, peeled and sliced  
* 2–3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced  
* 4 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen)  
* 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth  
* 1 cup milk or cream (optional, for creaminess)  
* ½ tsp dried thyme (optional)  
* Salt and pepper, to taste  
* ½ cup shredded cheese (optional topping)  

## Directions  

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes.  
2. Add the sliced carrots and diced potatoes, stirring for 5 minutes to start softening.  
3. Pour in the broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes and carrots are tender (about 15 minutes).  
4. Stir in the broccoli florets and cook an additional 5–7 minutes, until bright green and tender.  
5. For a creamy soup, use an immersion blender to partially or fully purée. For a rustic soup, leave it chunky.  
6. Stir in milk or cream if desired, season with thyme, salt, and pepper to taste.  
7. Serve hot, topped with shredded cheese or fresh herbs if desired.
