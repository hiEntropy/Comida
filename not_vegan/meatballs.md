## Ingredience

* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 pound ground pork
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
* 1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
* salt and ground black pepper to taste
* 2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled
* 1 ½ cups lukewarm water
* 1 cup olive oil 
 
## Directions

1. Combine beef, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.
2. Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.
3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)
