## Ingredients

### Carrot Cake

- 2 cups (260 g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled  
- 2 teaspoons baking soda  
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt  
- 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon  
- 1¼ cups (295 ml) vegetable oil  
- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar  
- 1 cup (190 g) lightly packed brown sugar  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature  
- 3 cups (300 g) grated peeled carrots (about 5 to 6 medium carrots)  
- 1 cup (120 g) coarsely chopped pecans  
- ½ cup (70 g) raisins  

### Creamy Frosting

- 8 ounces (225 g) cream cheese, at room temperature  
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch (optional)  
- 1¼ cups (140 g) powdered sugar  
- ⅓ cup (80 ml) cold heavy cream  
- ½ cup (50 g) coarsely chopped pecans, for topping  

## Equipment

- Two 9-inch round cake pans  
- Parchment paper (for lining pans)  
- Rubber spatula  
- Mixing bowls  
- Handheld or stand mixer  

## Directions

### Bake Cake

1. **Preheat & Prep Pans**  
   Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment, then grease tops. Alternatively, grease and flour both bottom and sides.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**  
   In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon until well blended.

3. **Mix Wet Ingredients**  
   In a separate bowl, whisk together oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Add eggs one at a time, whisking after each.

4. **Combine Batter**  
   Switch to a rubber spatula. Stir in dry ingredients in 3 parts, scraping down the sides. Mix just until smooth.

5. **Add Carrots & Extras**  
   Fold in grated carrots, chopped pecans, and raisins until evenly distributed.

6. **Bake**  
   Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until cake springs back when touched and a toothpick comes out clean.

7. **Cool**  
   Let cakes cool in pans for 15 minutes. Turn out onto racks, remove parchment, and cool completely.

### Frost Cake

1. **Make Frosting**  
   In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Sift and beat in powdered sugar and cornstarch (if using), ¼ cup at a time.

2. **Add Cream**  
   Pour in cold heavy cream. Beat for 2 to 3 minutes until whipped and creamy. Chill until ready to use.

3. **Assemble**  
   Once cakes are cool, frost top of one layer. Add second layer and frost top. Swirl frosting with a spatula. Leave sides unfrosted. Sprinkle chopped pecans on top.

## Notes

- **Storage:**  
  Frosted cake keeps up to 1 week in the fridge, covered. Unfrosted layers can be refrigerated up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

- **Cream Cheese Frosting (Alternative):**  
  Beat 16 oz cream cheese + ½ cup softened butter, then add 4½ cups powdered sugar, 1¼ tsp vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Beat until creamy. Thin with 1 Tbsp cream if needed.

- **Optional Variations:**  
  - Cupcakes: Makes 24, bake 14–18 mins  
  - 9x13 pan: Bake slightly longer  
  - Bundt pan: Increase bake time by 30%  
  - Pineapple: Add up to 1 cup (fresh or drained canned)

- **Flour Measuring Tip:**  
  Spoon flour into cup and level with a straight edge. Don’t scoop directly from bag.

- **Heavy Cream Tip (US Bakers):**  
  Use "heavy cream" or "heavy whipping cream" (36% fat). Avoid "whipping cream" (<35%), which may yield runny frosting.

- **International Bakers:**  
  Use plain flour for cake and "double cream" or "thickened cream" (35%+) for frosting.
