# Chashu Pork Butt

Slow-braised pork butt, inspired by traditional Japanese chashu, perfect for ramen or rice bowls. Tender, flavorful slices with a savory-sweet glaze.

## Ingredients

### Pork & Braising Liquid

- 1/2 cup soy sauce  
- 1/2 cup mirin  
- 1 cup water  
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed  
- 2-inch piece of ginger, sliced  
- 2 green onions, cut into large pieces  
- 2 tbsp sugar (optional, for slight sweetness)  
- 2–3 lb pork butt (boneless preferred)

## Directions

1. **Sear the Pork:**  
   Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Sear the pork butt on all sides until evenly browned.

2. **Prepare the Braise:**  
   In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, combine soy sauce, mirin, water, garlic, ginger, green onions, and sugar (if using). Add the seared pork.

3. **Cook Low and Slow:**  
   Cover and simmer on low for 2 to 3 hours, turning the pork occasionally, until it becomes tender and easy to slice.  
   _Alternative:_ Use a pressure cooker and cook on high pressure for about 50 minutes.

4. **Rest and Slice:**  
   Remove the pork from the pot and let it rest for 10–15 minutes. Slice thinly against the grain.

5. **Optional – Use the Braising Liquid:**  
   Strain and reduce the braising liquid if desired. It can be drizzled over the pork or added to ramen broth for extra flavor.

## Notes

- For added umami, a splash of sake or a dash of fish sauce can be included in the braising liquid.
- This pork can be stored in the braising liquid in the fridge for up to 3 days, or frozen for future use.
