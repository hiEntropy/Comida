# Thai Red Curry with Chicken, Pumpkin & Green Beans

A bold, creamy, and comforting Thai red curry featuring juicy chicken thighs, sweet pumpkin, and crisp green beans in a fragrant coconut broth.

## Ingredients

### Red Curry Paste – Choose One

- 5–6 tbsp Thai Red Curry Paste (Maesri recommended)¹  
**OR**  
- 1 quantity homemade Thai Red Curry Paste  

### Extras (Only if using jar curry paste)²

- 2 large garlic cloves, minced  
- 2 tsp fresh ginger, finely grated  
- 1 tbsp lemongrass paste or finely chopped fresh lemongrass³  

### Curry Base

- 3 tbsp vegetable oil (or canola/peanut)  
- 1 cup (250 ml) chicken broth, low sodium  
- 400 ml / 14 oz full-fat coconut milk  
- 6 kaffir lime leaves⁴  
- 1 tbsp sugar (white, brown, or palm)  
- 2 tsp fish sauce, plus more to taste  
- 350 g / 12 oz chicken thighs, boneless & skinless, sliced 1/3" thick⁵  
- 150 g / 5 oz pumpkin or butternut squash, cubed (~1 heaped cup)  
- 120 g / 4 oz green beans, trimmed & cut into 2" pieces  
- 12 Thai basil leaves⁶  

### Garnishes & Serving

- Fresh red chilli slices  
- Fresh cilantro leaves  
- Steamed jasmine rice  

## Directions

1. **Cook the Curry Paste**  
   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add curry paste and “Extras” (if using jar paste). Sauté for ~2 minutes until paste begins to dry out.

2. **Add Broth**  
   Stir in chicken broth and simmer for 3 minutes or until reduced by half.

3. **Add Coconut Milk & Seasonings**  
   Add coconut milk, lime leaves, sugar, and fish sauce. Stir well.

4. **Cook the Chicken**  
   Add chicken to the skillet. Spread out evenly and bring to a simmer. Lower heat to medium and cook for 8–10 minutes until chicken is cooked and sauce thickens.

5. **Taste & Adjust**  
   Taste the sauce. Add fish sauce for saltiness, sugar for sweetness, or a bit of shrimp paste if desired.

6. **Add Vegetables**  
   Stir in pumpkin and green beans. Cook for 3 more minutes, or until pumpkin is tender and sauce has thickened to a pourable, gravy-like consistency.

7. **Finish with Basil**  
   Remove from heat. Stir in Thai basil.

8. **Serve**  
   Ladle curry over jasmine rice. Top with red chili slices and cilantro, if desired.

## Notes

¹ **Curry Paste**  
Maesri brand (in cans) is highly recommended. Use 5 tbsp for medium heat or up to 6 tbsp for a spicier curry. Homemade paste requires more volume than jarred.

² **Jarred Paste Extras**  
Jarred pastes lack fresh aromatics—garlic, ginger, and lemongrass bring them to life. Not needed with homemade paste.

³ **Lemongrass**  
Use refrigerated paste or 2 tsp minced fresh lemongrass. Avoid dried.

⁴ **Kaffir Lime Leaves**  
Fresh is best for aroma and flavor. Substitute with dried if needed, using same amount.

⁵ **Chicken Cuts**  
Thighs are ideal for juiciness. Breast or tenderloin can be used, but monitor closely to avoid drying out.

⁶ **Thai Basil**  
Has a slight anise flavor. Use regular basil if unavailable (just a small handful).

### Additional Tips

- **Spiciness**: Red curry has a mild kick. Adjust spice level by increasing or decreasing the paste.
- **Sauce Consistency**: Authentic curry sauce may appear slightly split from the coconut oil—this is normal.
- **Substitutions**: Pumpkin is common and delicious in red curry. Green beans or snake beans also work great. Thai eggplant is authentic but optional.
