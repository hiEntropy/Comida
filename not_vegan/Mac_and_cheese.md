# Classic Mac and Cheese

A creamy, cheesy, stovetop mac and cheese made with sharp cheddar, gouda, and a hint of Old Bay for a flavorful twist.

## Ingredients

- 12 oz dry elbow macaroni  
- ¼ cup unsalted butter  
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour  
- 2½ cups whole milk  
- ¼ tsp table salt  
- ¼ tsp black pepper, plus more for topping  
- ¼ garlic powder (or to taste)
- cayenne powder to taste
- ¼ tsp onion powder to taste 
- 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded  
- 4 oz gouda cheese, shredded  
- Paprika, for topping  

## Equipment

- Large pot for boiling pasta  
- Large skillet or saucepan  
- Silicone or balloon whisk  
- Wooden spoon or spatula  

## Directions

1. **Cook Pasta**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni to al dente according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

2. **Make Roux**  
   In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Whisk in flour to form a paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes until the roux is lightly browned.

3. **Add Milk & Seasoning**  
   Slowly whisk in milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add salt, pepper, and Old Bay. Continue whisking until the mixture begins to thicken.

4. **Melt the Cheese**  
   Add shredded cheddar and gouda. Stir until the cheese is fully melted and smooth.

5. **Simmer to Thicken**  
   Bring the cheese sauce to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5–10 minutes.

6. **Combine with Pasta**  
   Add cooked macaroni and stir to combine. Serve immediately, topped with a sprinkle of paprika and more black pepper to taste.

## Notes

- **Storage**: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for 3–4 days.

- **Reheating**: Add a splash of milk and reheat in the microwave for 1–2 minutes, or gently warm on the stovetop over low heat with a splash of milk.

- **Substitutions**:  
  Gouda can be swapped for mild cheddar or gruyere. For a spicier twist, add a pinch of cayenne or hot sauce.
