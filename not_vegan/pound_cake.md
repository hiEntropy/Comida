# Best Pound Cake

A rich, buttery pound cake with a dense crumb and a smooth finish. Perfect on its own or with fresh fruit and whipped cream.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups (455 g) unsalted butter, softened  
- 3 ½ cups (700 g) granulated sugar  
- 6 large whole eggs¹  
- 6 large egg yolks¹ (in addition to the whole eggs)  
- 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 3 ½ cups (438 g) all-purpose flour²  

## Equipment

- 10-inch tube pan or 12-cup bundt pan  
- Stand mixer (recommended)  
- Mixing bowls  
- Spatula  

## Directions

1. **Preheat & Prepare Pan**  
   Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease generously with shortening and flour a 10-inch tube or 12-cup bundt pan. Shake out excess flour and set aside.

2. **Cream Butter**  
   In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy and smooth using a stand mixer (preferred due to large batter volume).

3. **Add Sugar**  
   Scrape the bowl, add granulated sugar, and beat until light and fluffy (1–2 minutes).

4. **Combine Egg Mixture**  
   In a medium bowl, combine whole eggs, extra yolks, vanilla, and salt. Lightly beat with a fork until yolks are broken and ingredients are incorporated.

5. **Incorporate Eggs Slowly**  
   With mixer on low speed, gradually pour in the egg mixture in a slow stream (or in 6 parts if needed), allowing each addition to fully incorporate. Scrape down sides and bottom, then beat on medium-high for 1–2 minutes.

6. **Add Flour Gradually**  
   Reduce speed to low and add flour about 1/4 cup at a time until fully mixed in. Scrape down again and beat on medium for 1 more minute.

7. **Fill Pan & Smooth**  
   Spread batter evenly in the prepared pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.

8. **Bake**  
   Bake for 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the thickest part comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Do **not** overbake.

9. **Cool & Remove**  
   Let cake cool for at least 20 minutes in the pan. Run a knife along edges and center, then invert onto a cooling rack and cool completely before serving.

## Notes

¹ **Eggs**  
You’ll use a total of 12 eggs: 6 whole eggs and 6 additional yolks. Discard or save the extra egg whites for other recipes like meringues or white cake.

² **Flour Substitution**  
Cake flour can be used in place of all-purpose:  
- By weight: 1:1 substitution  
- By volume: Use 3 ¾ cups + 2 Tablespoons of cake flour  
Do **not** use self-rising flour under any circumstances. Baking powder is **not** needed regardless of flour type.
